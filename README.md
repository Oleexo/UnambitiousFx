## Why choose UnambitiousFx?

### Simplicity

As Dr. Werner Vogels emphasized during his keynote at [AWS re:Invent 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim5x73crbM),
the key to great software lies in hiding complexity while exposing simplicity. Following this principle,
UnambitiousFx strives to create an intuitive and easy-to-use library that abstracts away unnecessary complications.
Rather than implementing fancy or trendy features, we focus on designing clean, natural interfaces that developers
can understand immediately. This approach ensures that our library remains accessible and maintainable while still
delivering powerful functionality.

### Modular architecture

Think of UnambitiousFx as a modular ecosystem where each component is like an independent island,
connected by clean interfaces and shared principles.
Each module is designed to stand on its own while working seamlessly with others.
The true power lies in its flexibility - you can choose to use any combination of modules that suits your needs,
or easily integrate individual components with your preferred third-party packages.
This pick-and-choose approach ensures you're not locked into using the entire framework
when you only need specific functionality.

### Web API development utilities

UnambitiousFx is designed to complement ASP.NET Core, not replace it.
The library provides additional features and utilities that enhance the development of fast,
efficient, and maintainable Web APIs while leveraging ASP.NET Core's robust foundation.

### Compatible with NativeAOT

Each library is meticulously designed with Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation in mind,
ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.
The Microsoft and .NET teams have invested significant resources into developing AOT capabilities,
enabling applications to be compiled directly to native machine code.
This results in faster startup times, reduced memory footprint, and improved runtime performance.
With the increasing challenges of cloud deployment, containerization, and the need for scalable microservices,
Native AOT compilation has become an essential feature for modern .NET applications.
By embracing AOT compilation, these libraries help deliver lightweight, high-performance
solutions that meet today's demanding deployment requirements.

## FAQ

### Why creating UnambitiousFx?

I created UnambitiousFx to share key concepts and patterns I've refined through years of web API development experience.
While not aiming to be the most popular .NET library, its focused purpose is to simplify and streamline common web API
development challenges.

Several excellent libraries that inspired me are transitioning to open source after years of reliable service. Rather
than replacing these libraries, UnambitiousFx offers an alternative approach built on solid architectural principles and
modern development practices.

### How will libraries evolve?

I actively maintain and update these libraries as I use them in my own projects, ensuring they adhere to the latest
web API development best practices in .NET.

The libraries are compiled against the most recent .NET Framework version and use the latest stable NuGet packages.
While maintaining compatibility with previous .NET versions, I'll continue support as long as it doesn't require
significant codebase divergence.

### Can you participate?

YES! Feel free to open a PR. All ideas are good. (most of them, I see you ;))

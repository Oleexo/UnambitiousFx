# UnambitiousFx

UnambitiousFx is a collection of libraries that facilitate web API development using best practices and a modular
approach.

## Why UnambitiousFx exists?

This project consolidates commonly used libraries that I have created repeatedly throughout my career and personal
projects. The goal is not to be the most popular .NET library, but rather to simplify various aspects of web API
development.

## Features

- Modular architecture
- Best practice implementations
- Web API development utilities
- Compatible with NativeAOT

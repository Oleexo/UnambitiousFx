# Advanced

Advanced usage of UnambitiousFx.Mediator: compile‑time registrations, AOT/trimming‑friendly patterns, and organization techniques for larger codebases. Start here when you need less boilerplate and zero runtime scanning.

## What you’ll learn
- Register handlers with the Mediator source generator (attribute‑based, compile‑time safe)
- Decide when to use generated vs. manual registrations
- Keep registrations AOT/trimming‑friendly (no runtime reflection scans)
- Structure larger apps (e.g., register groups) and how this interacts with behaviors

## Quick links
- Event orchestrator: ./event-orchestrator.html — Choose how to run event handlers (sequential, concurrent, or custom).
- Mediator generator: ./mediator-generator.html — Generate DI registrations for handlers at compile time; AOT‑safe, no reflection.

## Example: using generated registrations
```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using UnambitiousFx.Mediator;

var services = new ServiceCollection();

services.AddMediator(cfg =>
{
    // This class is generated by UnambitiousFx.Mediator.Generator in your project namespace
    MediatorRegistrations.Register(cfg);
});
```

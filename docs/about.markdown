## About UnambitiousFx

UnambitiousFx is a collection of C# libraries designed to simplify common programming tasks. The project was created with the philosophy that developer tools should be straightforward, well-documented, and focused on solving specific problems without unnecessary complexity.

### Our Philosophy

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**: We believe that the best tools are those that do one thing and do it well.
2. **Documentation Matters**: Good documentation is as important as good code.
3. **Modular Design**: Libraries should be independent and focused, allowing developers to use only what they need.
4. **Developer Experience**: APIs should be intuitive and easy to use.

### Project History

UnambitiousFx started as a collection of utilities and helpers that were repeatedly implemented across different projects. Instead of reinventing the wheel each time, we decided to create a set of libraries that could be reused and shared with the community.

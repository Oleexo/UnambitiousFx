# About UnambitiousFx

UnambitiousFx is a collection of libraries that facilitate web API development in .NET using best practices and a modular approach. The project focuses on simplicity, modularity, and compatibility with modern .NET features like Native AOT compilation.

## Philosophy

### Simplicity

As emphasized by Dr. Werner Vogels, "the key to great software lies in hiding complexity while exposing simplicity." UnambitiousFx follows this principle by creating intuitive and easy-to-use libraries that abstract away unnecessary complications. Rather than implementing fancy or trendy features, we focus on designing clean, natural interfaces that developers can understand immediately.

### Modular Architecture

UnambitiousFx is designed as a modular ecosystem where each component is like an independent island, connected by clean interfaces and shared principles. Each module is designed to stand on its own while working seamlessly with others. You can choose to use any combination of modules that suits your needs, or easily integrate individual components with your preferred third-party packages.

### Web API Development Utilities

The library is designed to complement ASP.NET Core, not replace it. UnambitiousFx provides additional features and utilities that enhance the development of fast, efficient, and maintainable Web APIs while leveraging ASP.NET Core's robust foundation.

### Native AOT Compatibility

Each library is meticulously designed with Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation in mind, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency. This results in faster startup times, reduced memory footprint, and improved runtime performance - essential features for modern .NET applications, especially in cloud and microservices environments.

## Project Evolution

UnambitiousFx is actively maintained and updated to adhere to the latest web API development best practices in .NET. The libraries are compiled against the most recent .NET Framework version and use the latest stable NuGet packages.

## FAQ

### Why creating UnambitiousFx?

I created UnambitiousFx to share key concepts and patterns I've refined through years of web API development experience.
While not aiming to be the most popular .NET library, its focused purpose is to simplify and streamline common web API
development challenges.

Several excellent libraries that inspired me are transitioning to open source after years of reliable service. Rather
than replacing these libraries, UnambitiousFx offers an alternative approach built on solid architectural principles and
modern development practices.

### How will libraries evolve?

I actively maintain and update these libraries as I use them in my own projects, ensuring they adhere to the latest
web API development best practices in .NET.

The libraries are compiled against the most recent .NET Framework version and use the latest stable NuGet packages.
While maintaining compatibility with previous .NET versions, I'll continue support as long as it doesn't require
significant codebase divergence.

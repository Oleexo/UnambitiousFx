/// Provides a mechanism to define custom behavior for handling requests in a processing pipeline.
/// Implementers of this interface can encapsulate logic that needs to be executed before or after
/// the request handler is invoked.
/// The interface supports two forms of request handling:
/// 1. A request without a response.
/// 2. A request that yields a specific response.
/// Implementations can utilize the provided `context`, `request`, and the `next` delegate to
/// customize or extend the handling process. The `next` delegate represents the subsequent
/// middleware or the actual request handler in the pipeline.
/// Generic Type Parameters:
/// - TRequest: Represents the type of the request being handled.
/// - TResponse: Represents the type of the response produced by the request.
